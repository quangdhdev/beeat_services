# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

### 1. Product Overview

The goal of this project is to create a web application similar to **demoqa.com**. The application will serve as a training and practice platform for developers and quality assurance (QA) testers. It will provide a variety of interactive web elements and functionalities for users to test their automation scripts and programming skills.

---

### 2. Problem Statement

QA testers and developers often need a reliable and stable environment to practice automation testing. Existing demo sites can be inconsistent or have limited features. This application aims to provide a comprehensive, stable, and well-documented set of web elements to facilitate hands-on learning and skill development in automation testing.

### 3. Features and Functionality

The application will be divided into several modules, each focusing on a specific category of web elements and user interactions.

#### 3.1 Elements
This section will contain standard HTML and web elements for testing basic interactions.
- **Text Box**: An input field for text entry.
- **Check Box**: A set of checkboxes for single and multiple selections.
- **Radio Button**: A set of radio buttons for single selection.
- **Web Tables**: A dynamic table with features to add, edit, and delete rows.
- **Buttons**: Various buttons with different events (e.g., click, right-click, double-click).
- **Links**: Internal and external hyperlinks, including broken links to test error handling.
- **Upload and Download**: Functionality to upload a file and download a sample file.
- **Dynamic Properties**: Elements with properties that change over time, requiring dynamic locators for testing.

#### 3.2 Forms
- **Practice Form**: A comprehensive form with various input types (text, date, dropdowns, checkboxes) to test form submission and validation.

#### 3.3 Alerts, Frame & Windows
- **Browser Windows**: Buttons to open new tabs and new browser windows.
- **Alerts**: Different types of alerts (standard, confirm, and prompt) to test alert handling.
- **Frames**: Webpages with embedded frames and nested frames for testing frame switching.
- **Modal Dialogs**: Buttons to trigger modal dialogs.

#### 3.4 Widgets
This section will contain more complex UI components.
- **Accordian**: A collapsible menu of content sections.
- **Auto Complete**: A text input that suggests options as the user types.
- **Date Picker**: A calendar widget for selecting dates.
- **Slider**: A draggable slider to select a value within a range.
- **Progress Bar**: A progress bar that updates its status dynamically.
- **Tabs**: A tabbed interface to switch between different content panels.
- **Tool Tips**: Elements with tooltips that appear on hover.
- **Menu**: A hierarchical dropdown menu.

#### 3.5 Interactions
This section will test advanced user interactions.
- **Sortable**: A list of items that can be reordered by dragging and dropping.
- **Selectable**: A grid or list of items where multiple items can be selected.
- **Resizable**: An element that can be resized by the user.
- **Droppable**: A target element where other elements can be "dropped" onto.
- **Dragabble**: Elements that can be dragged and moved around the page.

#### 3.6 Book Store Application
- **Login**: A basic login page with user authentication.
- **Book Store**: A list of books with details, allowing users to add them to a profile.
- **Profile**: A user profile page that displays their selected books.
- **Book Store API**: A set of APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books.

### 4. Technical Requirements

- **Platform**: A responsive web application accessible via modern web browsers.
- **Technology Stack**: To be determined by the development team (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js for frontend; Node.js, Python, or Java for backend).
- **Hosting**: Cloud-based hosting (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for scalability and reliability.

### 5. User Stories

- As a **QA tester**, I want to use a form with multiple input types so I can practice automating form submissions.
- As a **new developer**, I want to interact with resizable and draggable elements so I can learn how to handle complex UI actions in code.
- As an **automation engineer**, I want to test alert and modal dialogs so I can verify my scripts can handle unexpected pop-ups.
- As a **QA team**, we want a stable test environment that doesn't change frequently so our test scripts don't break unexpectedly.
